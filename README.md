# Classification of Frost in NASA images
- Achieved a test accuracy of 93% and test F1 of 94.8% after performing transfer learning on EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, VGG16 on satellite images supplied by NASA for class final project <br>
- Minimized effects of overfitting of CNN by applying 6 methods: L1 regularization, dropout layers, early stopping, batch normalization, data augmentation, and minimizing learning rate <br>
- Augmented images on Keras to induce variability by randomly cropping, flipping, rotating, translation, and changing contrast of images <br>
